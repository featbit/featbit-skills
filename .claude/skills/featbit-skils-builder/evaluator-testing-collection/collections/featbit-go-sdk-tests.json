Check import paths are correct\n2. Verify SDK initialized with options struct\n3. Confirm WaitForInitialization called\n4. Check middleware pattern\n5. Verify user stored in gin.Context\n\nPass Criteria:\n- Correct package imports\n- Proper initialization pattern\n- Gin-idiomatic middleware\n- User context properly managed\n- Complete working example\n\nFail Criteria:\n- Wrong import paths\n- No initialization wait\n- Not using gin.Context\n- Missing middleware pattern",
